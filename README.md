# Python-Chatap

Here is my version of a Python Chat app!

How to use:
  - set up the Server.py Scryp:
    Line  | Code | Input
    46    | HOST = '127.0.0.1â€™ | IP Adress of the Server you run the Server.py on
    47    | PORT = 33000       | Port over which you communicate
  - run the Server.py file on your SERVER
  - run the Client.py file on the computers you want to communicate
  - in the console type in your Server IP
  - in the console type in your Server Port
  - in the chat window type in your username
  - Enjoy chating in your own chatroom!

The Server has a default user limit of 5 connections!
To change this limit edit the Server.py file as follows:
 - set up the Server.py Scrypt:
    57    | SERVER.listen(5)  | Change (x) to your value
